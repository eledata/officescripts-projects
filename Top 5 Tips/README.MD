## Tip 1 - Use code completion and IntelliSence  

Per [VS Code document](), IntelliSense is a general term for various code editing features including: code completion, parameter info, quick info, and member lists. IntelliSense features are sometimes called by other names such as "code completion", "content assist", and "code hinting."

VS Code IntelliSense features are powered by a language service. A language service provides intelligent code completions based on language semantics and an analysis of your source code. If a language service knows possible completions, the IntelliSense suggestions will pop up as you type. If you continue typing characters, the list of members (variables, methods, etc.) is filtered to only include members containing your typed characters. Pressing Tab or Enter will insert the selected member.

You can trigger IntelliSense in any editor window by pressing `ctrl space` keys or by typing dot character (.) next to a variable or type. 

Among other things, the method signature will contain list of arguments it needs (if any), each argument's date type (can accept many types), whether a given argument required or optional, and the return type of the method. 

Use this code completion feature to explore the object model, discover API you need and learn how to use it.
